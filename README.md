### Spectralo TUI Website

This is the repo for my *personal website.*
You can normally acess it [here](https://spectralo.hackclub.app/) or [here](https://spectralo.me/)
It's a **cli like** website. Why ? Yes.

## How can you use it ?

If you want to use it, then do whatever you want with it. 
To test this project locally, clone the repo then run (if you dont have bun, replace it by npm) :
```
bun install
bun run dev
```
And then go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)
