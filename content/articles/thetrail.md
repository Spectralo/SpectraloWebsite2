title : "My trail adventure"

Trail was the greatest "hacky" event I've participated to.
At the start it wasnt all pink, I missed my bus and waited 7 hours in an aiport I've never been to, alone.
But I managed to solve my problems. And it made me learned a lot.
I loved the concept, I've always loved to talk while walking (This is the time when you have your best ideas -> Hackclub Merch (Soon tm))
But I wasnt sure if I was abqle to make it. I'm a hacker. Not a jogger. But at the end I was impressed by myself, we did more than 15km in one day.

During the trail I made some friends, thought a lot and saw beautiful landscapes ...
I made the conclusion writing all about this even would make me happy a day (Maybe in 10 years ...)
So this is my trail adventure day by day !!

### Day -1

From the start we had problems ... We got 1 hours late because of traffic ... Luckily, I wasnt alone and I went with some americans who where really kind to guide me in the airport. I was in the plane, at time, but really stressed. 
The flight went well, and everything was good until we landed. The flight entertainment system said we'll land at 1pm, and I trusted it.
Was a terrible mistake. We landed at 2pm, 1 hour late (Yes, again !). I wasnt really worried because my bus was at 4pm and even with half an hour to go there I had time for customs. Sadly, customs took 2 hours. The bus left. Without me.
Thanks Thomas for answering so fast and helping me. After a lot of discussing he said a flight to Reno would be a great alternative. But the only airline doing flights to Reno was United, and they didnt allow -15years old people to travel alone.
This is why I met Kognise ! She was extremely kind and helped me get my flight. After that, I went to the Airbnb (I was so tired I didnt even remember how ???)

### Day 1 (12/08/24)

Day started at 7am ... It was so hard ! But we made pancakes. Rlly good pancakes. My european mind was scared because they made pancakes out of only one "pancake powder" (Bonus : Give you 5 cancers at the same time !!!! Only 5$) but they were rlly tasty. 
After that we packed our food, and went outside to take a Uber. 
We arrived to our destination near the freeway, near the start of the Trail.
Few hours later, after eating and giving our pcbs projects, we were on the trail !
This is where I really started to talk with everyone. Everyone in the Tail group was so kind and supportive !
We walked a little (4 miles ?) and camped near a water source. (Water was so fresh and tasty !) 

### Day 2 (13/08/24)

Day 2 ... Quite dangerous day! We started hiking in the morning (After a tasty fig bar !) and we joined Body group later in the morning. We ate with them. Deven was a little bit worried because he saw thunderstorms alerts on the weather. Thomas decided to ignore it because the sky was clear (Big mistake I think). So basically we were hiking up the mountain and the rain started. very very hardly. and there were lightning really often. So we just unpacked our tent and chilled out. I was with Deeter and Hubbert and beside the noise, it was one of my preferred moments of the Trail. We played a german cardgame (Check Skyjo, really fun), showing pictures and talking. After the end of the storm, we got out and found a better place to camp. I wasnt really hungry so I tried backpackers pantry granola. It was quite good (for backpackers pantry ...)

### Day 3 (14/08/24)

The lake was 7 miles away. But we were super excited to swim ! In our way we made a campfire ! Was really good but sadly we havent any marshmallows ... 
Finally I made 10 miles because Thomas told us to let our backpacks at the intersection between the trail and the way to the lake. But the lake was like 1,5 miles away. So we did that 2 times to get our backpacks back.
When we arrived to the lake we swam a little bit and it was really refreshing.
We setup camp and slept.
(Thanks Thomas...)

### Day 4 (15/08/24)

During this day, we had some little problems, people wanted to quit and it took a long time to organise everything
So at 5 pm we had two choices :
- Choose to not make 4 miles to the next water source
- Do it anyway (and finish the trail)
Because Tail is super motivated, we chosed the second option ! Finally it was only a little walk. 
We waited the rain to stop and we started to hike.
During the mini-storm I was with Hunssein, Hubbert and Shiddart and they taught me how to play "Chopsticks" (Do you know this finger game ?)
When we arrived, we met Tim. He is know the trail very well and like to come with his pickup camp on the Trail.
He offered us lemonade ! It was really tasty. I loved his little plastic ducks all around his place.

### Day 5 (16/08/24)

This day was really challenging. The next water source was more than 12 miles away ...
So we had to go early and walk fast. The plan was to get up early at like 7 am but finally everyone woke up at 9 am.
We filled our bottle and left our camp at 11:30 am
The walk was very hard for me. I dont really know why because I already did 10 miles 2 days before and it wasnt this difficult
We managed to go to the highest point of the PCT and we found snow !!!!! (We made some gatorade slushie, I hope I wont die)
We arrived to a decent campsite (1 miles away from the water :/ ) right before night.
Everyone sat down for like 10 mins and after that we cooked some food and I went toÂ ~~bed~~ *sleeping pad*

### Day 6 (17/08/24)

Next day, we had two options (Again!):
- Go to Sierra City (*12 miles*, impossible)
- Go to the lake (Only 4 miles)

Thomas wanted us to go to Sierra City because on FarOut (the map app) there was public showers, wifi, ... (Civillisation !!!)
In all case we needed to pass by the Lake. When we arrived at the lake, we found that Head was camping there ! They didnt wanted to go to Sierra City (They were right). In fact, it was only a few little houses and nothing more ...
And we were offered a campsite by the owner of the camping ground ! We got some snickers, hot dog and watermelon. It was so good after backpackers pantry.
Finally we slept here and took a bus to Reno the next day (I've tasted boba for the first time ! Rlly ggood.)

This night was the last we spent on the Trail ...
This adventure was so cool and learningful.
Thanks Thomas, Nila, Deter and Deven for guiding us on the Trail
Thanks for the Tail group to be so kind
And thanks everyone who made this event possible
