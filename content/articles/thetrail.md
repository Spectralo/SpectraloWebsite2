Trail was the greatest "hacky" event I've participated to.
At the start it wasnt all pink, I missed my bus and waited 7 hours in an aiport I've never been to, alone.
But I managed to solve my problems. And it made me learned a lot.
I loved the concept, I've always loved to talk while walking (This is the time when you have your best ideas -> Hackclub Merch (Soon tm))
But I wasnt sure if I was able to make it. I'm a hacker. Not a jogger. But at the end I was impressed by myself, we did more than 15km in one day.

During the trail I made some friends, thought a lot and saw beautiful landscapes ...
I made the conclusion writing all about this even would make me happy a day (Maybe in 10 years ...)
So this is my trail adventure !!

### Day -1

From the start we had problems ... We got 1 hours late because of traffic ... Luckily, I wasnt alone and I went with some americans who where really kind to guide me in the airport. I was in the plane, at time, but really stressed. 
The flight went well, and everything was good until we landed. The flight entertainment system said we'll land at 1pm, and I trusted it.
Was a terrible mistake. We landed at 2pm, 1 hour late (Yes, again !). I wasnt really worried because my bus was at 4pm and even with half an hour to go there I had time for customs. Sadly, customs took 2 hours. The bus left. Without me.
Thanks Thomas for answering so fast and helping me. After a lot of discussing he said a flight to Reno would be a great alternative. But the only airline doing flights to Reno was United, and they didnt allow -15years old people to travel alone.
This is why I met Kognise ! She was extremely kind and helped me get my flight. After that, I went to the Airbnb (I was so tired I didnt even remember how ???)

### Day 1

Day started at 7am ... It was so hard ! But we made pancakes. Rlly good pancakes. My european mind was scared because they made pancakes out of only one "pancake powder" (Bonus : Give you 5 cancers at the same time !!!! Only 5$) but they were rlly tasty.
